# researcharr documentation — Day One

Welcome. The documentation site is intentionally minimal during the Day One
phase. We are focused on stabilizing core code and tests; detailed operator
and UI documentation is deferred to the `ROADMAP.md` and will be added as
features are proven.

Quick links

- ROADMAP: `ROADMAP.md` — planned features and priorities
- CONTRIBUTING: `docs/Contributing.md` — how to run tests, submit PRs, and
	get involved
- TESTS: `tests/` — unit tests and test guidance

If you'd like to expand the docs, open a PR against `docs/` — new pages will
be reviewed and added as core functionality is validated.
9. [PR Instructions](PR_INSTRUCTIONS.txt) — Quick commands and PR template guidance for submitting changes.
