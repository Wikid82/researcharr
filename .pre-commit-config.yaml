repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: "v0.14.3"  # pinned ruff pre-commit tag (update as needed)
    hooks:
      - id: ruff

  # NOTE: the previous mirrors-mypy hook would create an isolated install of
  # mypy which attempted to build native dependencies (typed-ast) and failed
  # in developer environments without system headers. To avoid requiring
  # system-level build tools in the pre-commit isolated env, we run mypy
  # from the developer's environment (system/python) below as a local hook.

  # YAML linting for configuration files
  - repo: https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint

  # Note: shellcheck integration omitted because the shellcheck mirror
  # pre-commit hook is not available in this environment. You can add
  # a shellcheck hook later (for example via a maintained pre-commit
  # wrapper) if desired.

  # Detect secrets in the codebase (Yelp detect-secrets)
  # Note: detect-secrets omitted here to avoid configuration mismatches; we
  # can add it later with a proper baseline file and tested hook id.

  # Note: Gitleaks integration can be added later with a tested pre-commit hook
  # if desired; omitted here to avoid unsupported/misconfigured hook manifests.

      # first failure and to enable CLI logging so failures provide more
      # immediate debugging information. If this becomes slow for commits
      # we can move it to the pre-push stage instead.

    # run local wrapper hooks at the pre-commit stage
    # (keeps behavior equivalent to prior config while using new stage name)

    # NOTE: pytest pre-push hook removed; a dedicated git pre-push hook will
    # be installed locally instead to avoid pre-commit re-running formatters
    # and other hooks during the push stage.
# Recommended usage:
# 1. Replace all <pin-*> placeholders with concrete tag names or commit hashes.
# 2. Install pre-commit in your environment: `pip install pre-commit`.
# 3. Run once to install the git hook: `pre-commit install`.
# 4. Optionally run across the repo: `pre-commit run --all-files`.
