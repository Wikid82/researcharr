  # Note: shellcheck integration omitted because the shellcheck mirror
  # pre-commit hook is not available in this environment. You can add
  # a shellcheck hook later (for example via a maintained pre-commit
  # wrapper) if desired.

  # Detect secrets in the codebase (Yelp detect-secrets)
  # Note: detect-secrets omitted here to avoid configuration mismatches; we
  # can add it later with a proper baseline file and tested hook id.

  # Note: Gitleaks integration can be added later with a tested pre-commit hook
  # if desired; omitted here to avoid unsupported/misconfigured hook manifests.

      # run local wrapper hooks at the pre-commit stage
      # (keeps behavior equivalent to prior config while using new stage name)

      # NOTE: pytest pre-push hook removed; a dedicated git pre-push hook will
      # be installed locally instead to avoid pre-commit re-running formatters
      # and other hooks during the push stage.

# Recommended usage:
# 1. Replace all <pin-*> placeholders with concrete tag names or commit hashes.
# 2. Install pre-commit in your environment: `pip install pre-commit`.
# 3. Run once to install the git hook: `pre-commit install`.
# 4. Optionally run across the repo: `pre-commit run --all-files`.
