name: "Deprecated: Propagate nightly to feature branches"

# This workflow used to run on pushes to `nightly` and created PRs into feature/* branches.
# The project no longer uses the `nightly` branch. Keep this workflow as a manual helper
# (workflow_dispatch) for backward compatibility; prefer `.github/workflows/propagate-development-to-features.yml` instead.
