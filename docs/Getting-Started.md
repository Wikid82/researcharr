# Getting Started

Follow these steps to run researcharr locally or in Docker.

Local (development)

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the app (example):

```bash
python researcharr.py serve
```

Docker

1. Build and run using Docker Compose (example):

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

2. The web UI is available on port `2929` by default.

Runtime variants

The project publishes two runtime variants: `distroless` (recommended for production, minimal runtime) and `alpine` (developer-friendly). For production runs use the `distroless` image and mount a persistent `/config` directory. For development, use `alpine` or the `builder` stage so you have a shell and dev tooling available.

- Security and initial credentials

- On first startup, if `config/webui_user.yml` does not exist, the web UI will open an interactive setup page where the operator can choose the initial admin username and password. The setup page also allows optionally entering an API token; if left blank the application will generate an API token and show it once on a success page so the operator can copy it securely. The password hash and API key hash are persisted to `config/webui_user.yml`.
- Note: the setup page is the default behavior for interactive installs and avoids printing secrets to container logs. For unattended/automated installs you can still auto-generate credentials by setting the `AUTO_GENERATE_WEBUI_CREDS=true` environment variable; this mimics legacy first-run behavior and will persist generated credentials. Use this only in automation scripts where logs are not relied upon to deliver secrets.

- Timezone behavior: the container entrypoint will attempt to write `/etc/localtime` for the configured timezone. If the container image or runtime disallows modifying `/etc/localtime` (for example read-only images or non-root restraints), the entrypoint will instead export the `TZ` environment variable for the process and persist the chosen timezone to `/config/timezone` so the application and scheduler have a reliable fallback.
- To change credentials after first-run use the User Settings page in the web UI.
- A password reset page is available at `/reset-password`. To enable web-based resets you must set the environment variable `WEBUI_RESET_TOKEN` to a secret value; the reset form must present this token to reset the password. If you do not set this variable, the reset page will display that reset is not available.

Configuration and config files

- See `config.example.yml` for configuration options. The container will auto-create `/config/config.yml` from the example if it's missing.

Important note about bind-mounting `/app`

If you mount a host directory onto `/app` (for example in a development compose where you mount your source tree into the container), files that were baked into the image at `/app` will be hidden by the mount. In particular, the bundled `config.example.yml` lives at the repository root and will be available at `/app/config.example.yml` inside the image â€” but it will be hidden if you mount another host folder over `/app` that doesn't contain the example file.

Recommendations:

- For production/operator usage: do not mount `/app`. Mount only `./config` to `/config` so the entrypoint can copy `/app/config.example.yml` into `/config/config.yml` on first-run.
- For development: mount your repository root into `/app` (for example `- ./:/app:delegated`) so that `/app/config.example.yml` remains present and you can edit source files on the host.
- Quick workaround if you must mount a host folder that does not contain `config.example.yml`: copy `config.example.yml` from the repository into the host path you are mounting, or copy the example into your host `./config/config.yml` before starting the container.
	Scheduling note: the app uses an in-process scheduler (APScheduler) to run the background processing according to a cron-like scheduler expression stored in `config.yml`. Edit this expression from the Scheduling tab in the web UI or directly in `config.yml`.

Health & Metrics

- researcharr exposes `/health` and `/metrics` on port `2929` for monitoring and Docker healthchecks.
