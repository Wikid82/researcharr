# Project Roadmap

The roadmap is now maintained in the project wiki for easier updates and collaboration. The wiki roadmap was recently reprioritized to emphasize core processing, reliability, and API/worker improvements before UI polish.

**See:** [Project Roadmap (Wiki)](../researcharr.wiki/Roadmap.md)
 
Note: the roadmap includes plans for release-aware processing: withhold processing of newly released files for a configurable window (default: 7 days) and skip items with no release date by default.
 
Planned: add a notifications layer (webhooks + popular services). Discord is a priority; consider Apprise for broad service support.
